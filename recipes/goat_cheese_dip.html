    <p>
      Goat cheese is baked with marinara sauce and topped with fresh basil to
      make this super easy appetizer in a flash! Serve fresh out of the oven
      with crostini or garlic bread for dipping.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) goat cheese log</li>
      <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher or sea salt (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh basil, cut into ribbons</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Press goat cheese to fit the shape of a small baking dish, leaving a
        1-inch border around the edge. Gently spoon marinara sauce around the
        border, taking care to cover the edge of goat cheese but not the middle.
        Sprinkle with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until goat cheese is hot and soft and
        marinara sauce is hot and bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and sprinkle with freshly chopped basil.</li>
    </ol>
